        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Catherine Lu was born on July 30th, 2003 and raised in the beautiful city of Irvine, California. She would grow up as the middle children of two brothers. Catherine would attend elementary, middle, and highschool within the studious Irvine Unified School District (IUSD). As IUSD was one of the best school districts, Catherine would become a hardworking, strong, and independent woman. <br><br>

        During her career as a student at Irvine High School she would take upon many new opportunities in order to gain more experience. She would work three different jobs during her highschool career. At all of her jobs she would be awarded employee of the month, multiple times. Additionally, Catherine would take upon many leadership positions, in both clubs and extracurriculars. By the end of her highschool career she would be the Varsity captain of both the tennis and lacrosse team. Catherine would also be a part of her middle schoolâ€™s and high schoolâ€™s choir and band. By her second year in highschool, after a rigorous audition process she would be in the schoolâ€™s top bands and choir. As well as volunteering her time and serving as officer positions in multiple national clubs. An example would be how she served as the President of the Make-A-Wish club for two years. The Make-A-Wish Club would support and help raise money to fund the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The club and foundation would focus on raising money in order to grant and support the last wishes of kids with terminal illnesses. Catherine would continue her highschool journey whilst facing some of the hardest things that life can throw at someone. Despite the challenges and losses she faced, she would only come back stronger. Catherineâ€™s highschool experience would come to a steady end, and she would finally graduate as a student on the Principalâ€™s List all four years. Catherine would eventually choose to dedicate the next four years of her academic career to the University of California, Riverside. She would begin as a biology major, however after having the opportunity to take a wide range of classes, would be heavily interested in Business. <br><br>

        Now at the University of California, Riverside, she would join many clubs and organizations, with interest in joining more. She is currently in a social sorority that has allowed her to grow so much on a personal level.  She would hope to be able to join a professional business fraternity in order to help gain even more experience. Catherine hopes to concentrate either in Marketing or Finance as a business major.
